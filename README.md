Diabetes Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This repository provides an implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. This README provides a comprehensive analysis of the code, along with insights into the machine learning concepts and techniques used.

Overview

The goal of this project is to predict whether a patient has diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The dataset used is the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, which contains various health-related metrics such as glucose concentration, blood pressure, and BMI.

Data Preprocessing

The dataset is loaded using pandas, a powerful data manipulation library in Python. The first few rows of the dataset are displayed to understand its structure and contents.

The target variable is stored in the column 'y', and the features are the first 8 columns of the dataset. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function.

Feature Scaling

Feature scaling is a crucial step in preprocessing, especially for algorithms like KNN that are distance-based. The StandardScaler from scikit-learn is used to standardize the features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm

The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a simple, instance-based learning algorithm that classifies a data point based on the majority class among its k-nearest neighbors in the training set.

Distance Calculation
A custom distance function is implemented to calculate the Euclidean distance between two points.

KNN Function
The KNN function iterates over all training instances to calculate their distance to the query instance, sorts the distances, and selects the top k neighbors to determine the most common class label among them.

Model Evaluation

The model's performance is evaluated using the testing set. Predictions are made for each test instance, and the classification report is generated using scikit-learn's classification_report function, which provides detailed metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score.

Metrics
Accuracy: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
Precision: The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positives.
Recall (Sensitivity): The ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.
F1-Score: The weighted average of Precision and Recall.
Conclusion

This project demonstrates the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict diabetes using the Pima Indians Diabetes Database. The code includes data preprocessing, feature scaling, implementing the KNN algorithm, and evaluating the model using various classification metrics.
